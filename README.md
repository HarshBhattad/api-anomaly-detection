# 🚨 Intelligent API Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning & Time Series Forecasting

This project simulates a production-grade anomaly detection pipeline for API logs using both unsupervised machine learning and time-series modeling. It identifies silent failures, latency spikes, status code surges, and traffic drops across 50,000+ synthetic API records.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Isolation Forest** for feature-based anomaly detection
- 📈 **Prophet** for traffic volume forecasting and residual-based anomaly spotting
- 🧠 Advanced rolling features: latency, error rate, traffic patterns
- 📊 Clear visualizations and a combined anomaly dashboard
- ✅ Categorized anomalies: silent failures, backend errors, traffic spikes/drops
